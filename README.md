# Cryptocurrencies

## **Overview**

In this weeks challenge we were tasked with analyzing cryptocurrency data. We started with over a thousand cryptos and through eliminating null and n/a values, keeping only currencies that were traded, and eliminating columns of info we didn't need, we were able to look over the data. We took our final numbers and info and ran them through Pandas get_dummies to sync all of our data, then it was scaled through StandardScaler so we could run it through our PCA model. 

In the end, we created a few graphs to visualize the currencies, created a sortable table, and a simple scatter chart to see the results.
